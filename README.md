👋 Hi, I’m Borys — Google Apps Script Developer & Low-code Automation Engineer.
I build automation solutions using Google Workspace, Apps Script, and external REST APIs.

My first acquaintance with Google Apps Script was through a video tutorial on website parsing. 
I studied the code line by line and wrote instruction for this script. 
Thanks to this, I was able to develop my Apps Script skills and write first scripts that connect to web services via the API, and later write scripts that integrate with OpenAPI. 
Also, thanks to this I improved my knowledge in Postman.
